# Spiel Syntax

The syntax for Spiel is simple enough to be detailed in this single document.

If you're curious the original language specification is [available as a PDF](https://github.com/The-Code-In-Sheep-s-Clothing/Example-DSTL/blob/master/BGL-Syntax.pdf).

TODO needs the rest of the spiel syntax here...
