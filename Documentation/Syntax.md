The original language specification is [available as a PDF](https://github.com/The-Code-In-Sheep-s-Clothing/Example-DSTL/blob/master/BGL-Syntax.pdf). This comprehensively describes the design of our language from a technical viewpoint, but also provides some rationale and justification for the decisions as well.
