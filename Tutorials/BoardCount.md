...This tutorial will be coming soon!...

If you've gotten this far you're at the end of our tutorials! We hope that these exercises have been enlightening, and that you feel a bit better about what a programming language is about. The idea of Spiel is to give you an easy way to get started with programming. From here on out you may continue with Spiel, or you may try out a new language, but a lot of the concepts and ideas you've learned here will hopefully be helpful going forward!
