# 1) Getting Started with Spiel

Getting started with Spiel is straightforward, as you can start coding directly in our [online tool](http://access.engr.orst.edu:5168/). However this is currently limited to OSU students, staff, and faculty that have access to the OSU network directly or via a VPN.


Once you have access to the tool you should see the page as follows:

There are 2 main areas of focus.

The white screen on the left is **editor**, this is where you can type in your code to run.

The black screen on the right is the **REPL** (pronounced reh-pull). REPL stands for read-evaluate-prrint loop. It repeats the process of reading the command you entered (an **expression**), evaluating it, and displaying the result. This is where you can run your spiel programs, and check the results of your code. You can also get feedback for errors and issues. When you start a game, you will be able to interact with it from this screen as well.

You must have a valid program in the editor to be able to enter and run code in the REPL. Any updates you make in the editor on the left will be reflected in the REPL expression you enter afterwards.
