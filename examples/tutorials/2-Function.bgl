-- Lesson 2: A slightly more exciting game. We call a function to play the game.

game Two

type Player = {Player1, Player2}

-- Arbitrary Board/Input; they do not matter for this game.
type Board = Array (1,1) of Bool
type Input = Bool

-- a type synonym
type Result = {P1Wins, P2Wins}

play : Player -> Result
play(p) = if p == Player1 then P1Wins else P2Wins
