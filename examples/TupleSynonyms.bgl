game TestTupleSynonyms

-- A test to check that types are properly assigned to parameters
-- of multi-argument functions with type synonyms

type T = Int

type Pair1 = (T,T)
type Pair2 = Pair1
type Pair3 = Pair2

-- a bug resulted in x : Pair3, y : Pair3, which makes this function ill-typed
-- A well-typed f is a reasonable indication that bugs of this class don't occur
f : Pair3 -> Pair3
f(x,y) = (x,y)
